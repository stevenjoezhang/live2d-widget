## Features

- Add Live2D widget to web page
- Lightweight, with no runtime dependencies other than Live2D Cubism Core
- Core code is written in TypeScript, making it easy to integrate

*Note: The character models above are for demonstration purposes only and are not included in this repository.*

You can also check out example web pages:

- Check the effect in the lower left corner of [Mimi's Blog](https://zhangshuqiao.org)
- [demo/demo.html](https://live2d-widget.pages.dev/demo/demo) to demonstrate basic functionality
- [demo/login.html](https://live2d-widget.pages.dev/demo/login) to imitate the login interface of NPM

## Usage

If you are a beginner or only need the basic functionality, you can simply add the following line of code to the `head` or `body` of your HTML page to load the widget:

```html
<script src="https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/npm/live2d-widgets@1.0.0-rc.6/dist/autoload.js"></script>
```

The placement of the code depends on how your website is built. For example, if you are using [Hexo](https://hexo.io), you need to add the above code to the template file of your theme. The modification process is similar for pages generated using various template engines.  
If your website uses PJAX, since the widget does not need to be refreshed on every page, make sure to place the script outside the PJAX refresh area.

**However, we strongly recommend configuring the widget yourself to make it more suitable for your website!**  
If you are interested in customizing the widget, please refer to the detailed instructions below.

## Configuration

You can refer to the source code of `dist/autoload.js` to see the available configuration options. `autoload.js` will automatically load two files: `waifu.css` and `waifu-tips.js`. `waifu-tips.js` creates the `initWidget` function, which is the main function for loading the widget. The `initWidget` function accepts an object-type parameter as the configuration for the widget. The following are the available options:

| Option | Type | Default Value | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ------------- | ----------- |
| `waifuPath` | `string` | `https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/npm/live2d-widgets@1/dist/waifu-tips.json` | Path to the widget resources, can be modified |
| `cdnPath` | `string` | `https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/gh/fghrsh/live2d_api/` | CDN path |
| `cubism2Path` | `string` | `https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/npm/live2d-widgets@1/dist/live2d.min.js` | Path to Cubism 2 Core |
| `cubism5Path` | `string` | `https://cubism.live2d.com/sdk-web/cubismcore/live2dcubismcore.min.js` | Path to Cubism 5 Core |
| `modelId` | `number` | `0` | Default model id |
| `tools` | `string[]` | see `autoload.js` | Buttons of the loaded tools |
| `drag` | `boolean` | `false` | Make the widget draggable |
| `logLevel` | `string` | `error` | Log level: `error`, `warn`, `info`, `trace` |

## Model Repository

This repository does not include any models. You need to configure a separate model repository and set it via the `cdnPath` option.  
Older versions of the `initWidget` function supported the `apiPath` parameter, which required users to set up their own backend. You can refer to [live2d_api](https://github.com/fghrsh/live2d_api) for details. The backend interface would integrate model resources and dynamically generate JSON description files. Since version 1.0, these features have been implemented on the frontend, so a dedicated `apiPath` is no longer required. All model resources can be provided statically. As long as `model_list.json` and the corresponding `textures.cache` for each model exist, features such as outfit changing are supported.

## Development

If the options provided in the "Configuration" section above are not enough to meet your needs, you can make modifications yourself. The directory structure of this repository is as follows:

- `src` directory contains the TypeScript code for each component, e.g. the button and dialog box.
- `build` directory contains files generated from the source code in `src` (please do not modify them directly!)
- `dist` directory contains the files that can be directly used on web pages after packaging, including:
  - `autoload.js` is used to automatically load other resources such as style sheets.
  - `waifu-tips.js` is automatically generated by `build/waifu-tips.js` and it is not recommended to modify it directly.
  - `waifu.css` is the style sheet for the widget.
  - `waifu-tips.json` defines the triggering conditions (`selector`, CSS selector) and the displayed text when triggered (`text`).  
    By default, the CSS selector rules in `waifu-tips.json` are effective for the Hexo [NexT theme](https://github.com/next-theme/hexo-theme-next), but you may need to modify or add new content to make it suitable for your own website.  
    **Warning: The content in `waifu-tips.json` may not be suitable for all age groups or appropriate to access during work. Please ensure their suitability when using them.**

To deploy the development testing environment of this project locally, you need to install Node.js and npm, then execute the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stevenjoezhang/live2d-widget.git
npm install
```

If you need to use Cubism 3 or newer models, please download and extract the Cubism SDK for Web separately into the `src` directory, for example, `src/CubismSdkForWeb-5-r.4`. Due to Live2D license agreements (including the Live2D Proprietary Software License Agreement and Live2D Open Software License Agreement), this project cannot include the source code of Cubism SDK for Web.  
If you only need to use Cubism 2 models, you can skip this step. The code in this repository complies with the Redistributable Code terms of the Live2D license agreements.  
Once completed, use the following command to compile and bundle the project.


```bash
npm run build
```

The TypeScript code in the `src` directory is compiled into the `build` directory, and the code in the `build` directory is further bundled into the `dist` directory.  
To support both Cubism 2 and Cubism 3 (and newer) models while minimizing code size, Cubism Core and related code are loaded dynamically based on the detected model version.

## Deploy

After making modifications locally, you can deploy the modified project on a server or load it via a CDN. To make it easier to customize, you can fork this repository and push your modified content to your own repository using `git push`.

### Using jsDelivr CDN

To load forked repository via jsDelivr, the usage method becomes:

```html
<script src="https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/gh/username/live2d-widget@latest/autoload.js"></script>
```

Replace `username` with your GitHub username. To ensure the content of the CDN is refreshed correctly, you need to create a new git tag and push it to the GitHub repository. Otherwise, `@latest` in the URL will still point to the previous version. Additionally, CDN itself has caching, so the changes may take some time to take effect.

### Using Cloudflare Pages

You can also deploy using Cloudflare Pages. Create a new project in Cloudflare Pages and select your forked repository. Then, set the build command to `npm run build`. Once configured, Cloudflare Pages will automatically build and deploy your project.

### Self-host

Alternatively, you can directly host these files on your server instead of loading them via CDN.

- Clone the forked repository onto your server, or upload the local files to the website directory on the server using `ftp` or similar methods.
- If you are deploying a static blog using Hexo or similar tools, place the code of this project in the blog's source file directory (e.g., the `source` directory). When redeploying the blog, the relevant files will be automatically uploaded to the corresponding paths. To prevent these files from being incorrectly modified by Hexo plugins, you may need to set `skip_render`.

Afterwards, the entire project can be accessed through your domain name. You can try opening the `autoload.js` and `live2d.min.js` files in your browser and confirm that their content is complete and correct.
If everything is normal, you can proceed to modify the constant `live2d_path` in `autoload.js` to the URL of the `dist` directory. For example, if you can access `live2d.min.js` through the following URL:

```
https://example.com/path/to/live2d-widget/dist/live2d.min.js
```

then modify the value of `live2d_path` to:

```
https://example.com/path/to/live2d-widget/dist/
```

Make sure to include the trailing `/` in the path.
Once done, add the following code to the interface where you want to add the live2d-widget:

```html
<script src="https://example.com/path/to/live2d-widget/dist/autoload.js"></script>
```

This will load the widget.
